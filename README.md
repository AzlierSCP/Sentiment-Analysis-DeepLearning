# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Movie-Reviews-Using-Deep-Learning
I am going to design a DNN to complete the sentiment analysis task, using the popular publicly available SST2 datasets, which is a movie review dataset, each sample contains a sentence and the corresponding label of the sentence, 1 means positive and 0 means negative. for this, we need to design a suitable text embedding and DNN, such as RNN/GRU/LSTM, etc., and compare the performances of different models
